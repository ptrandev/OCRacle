# Libraries

This includes any necessary library files that could not be installed via
pip for some reason.

The following external libraries are included in this directory:
- [eminist](https://github.com/hosford42/EMNIST/) - This allows for the
  download, extraction, and loading of the EMNIST dataset. This has been
  included because the original tool has a critical patch that has not been
  published to PyPi.
